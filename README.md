# Religion-Epicurus-Trilemma
If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not all-powerful. If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not all-good. If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist?

Apologetic Trilemma
Lunatic: Jesus was not God, but he mistakenly believed that he was.
Liar: Jesus was not God, and he knew it, but he said so anyway.
Lord: Jesus is God.

In law
The "cruel trilemma"
A breach of religious oath if they lied (taken extremely seriously in that era, a mortal sin),[7] as well as perjury;
Self-incrimination if they told the truth; or
Contempt of court if they said nothing and were silent.

In philosophy
The Münchhausen trilemma
All justifications in pursuit of certain knowledge have also to justify the means of their justification and doing so they have to justify anew the means of their justification. Therefore, there can be no end. We are faced with the hopeless situation of an infinite regression.
One can stop at self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or speaking ex cathedra or at any other evidence, but in doing so the intention to install certain justification is abandoned.
The third horn of the trilemma is the application of a circular argument.

The trilemma of censorship
True – in which case society is robbed of the chance to exchange error for truth;
False – in which case the opinion would create a 'livelier impression' of the truth, allowing people to justify the correct view;
Half-true – in which case it would contain a forgotten element of the truth, that is important to rediscover, with the eventual aim of a synthesis of the conflicting opinions that is the whole truth.
